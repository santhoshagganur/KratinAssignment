# Swastha Application

This is frontend based application. In this application, i can build a frontend pages using react.

Swastha is a sanskrit word, which means health. To provide new innovations in health care domain i used this word for my application.

This is a small application i was build in health care domain, now a days we all are facing lot of health issues, in case of senior citizens we take some of common issues and we generated small awareness, in this app i can added feature to take a test in your home. When you fill the form with in 15 minutes our health advisor will contact you, with in 24 hours we can deliver your test results accurately.

Also we can share track of your test results through the whatsapp (currently not available).

I can build a medication remainder, currently it is in the initial stage as soon as possible we can expand this feature to all diseases. Presently it works on type 2 diabetes.

I thought that only the medication is not working through all diseases so i can innovate a new feature for senior citizens. In this feature they got how to spend a life in day to day. (This feature is because health is not only depends on our body, it also depends on our feelings, our surroundings, and how our thought process will going. So i hope this feature show some results in our life.)

## Features

step1: Firstly i can build a Home page for users in this you will get a more about our idealogy, and how we can work, what is our goal each and every details about the application we provide there. In the home application i can built majorly 3 features in the first tab (Home), you will get breif about our vision and what we providing for our users.

step2: In this application in second tab(Above65), here i can built a suggestions what was the major key things that can impact majorly on senior citiens, on a day to day basis what we can improve to maintain a stable and healthy life.

step3: In this application the third tab(Online Labs), here i can built a small form to take the users data, basis of that we can provide health checkups in a easy and simle manner. I built this feature for seniors because they do not able to go for heath checkups in hospitals. So this app will be a add advantage for them.


step4: In this application i can added a one more feature for medication remainders. Presently it is in initial stage (it works for only type 2 diabetic patients) we expand this feature as soon as possible.
